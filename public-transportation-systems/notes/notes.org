* Introduction

** Transit right now
- Ridership is increasing, but small
- Strong financial support from
- Trends in modal split
  - Auto is above 80%
  - Transit 2-3%
  - Biking and walking are the same as transit

** Funding
- In North America, it's divided into captial and operating expenses
- Fares only pay ~1/3 of operational expenses
- Lots of federal support for capital expenses - almost 40%
  - Since operating expenses are funded less, this encourages more building and less maintenance
- Fuel taxes in NA are 10-20% of what they are in Europe

** Traditional Arguments Supporting Transit
- Equity: travel for those who can't drive
- Congestion
  - Not such a good argument, papers don't support it. The capacity released it quickly filled again
- Better for the environment
  - Actually, effort it better spent making cars cleaner since they're like 80% of transport

** Critical assessment
- Transport has been stabilized
- Success stories (NYC, Houston(?), Seattle)
- Institutional changes are occurring slowly

** Future influences
- Urban form
- More old people
- Better tech to improve performance
- Public has higher expectation (you know exactly when the bus is coming)

** Ingredients for future success
- Maintain supportive coalition
- Expand the definition of public transport
- Greater private sector involvement
- Aggressive implementation of new technology

* Data Collection Techniques and Program Design

** Summary of current practice
- Used to be manual
- Now is collected with IoT devices
- *Automated Data Collection Systems (ADCS)*
  - *Automated Fare Collection Systems (AFC)*
    - Tapping your card on/off the vehicle
  - *Automatic Vehicle Location Systems (AVL)*
    - GPS tracking for buses, train tracking based on circuit occupancy
  - *Automatic Passenger Counting Systems (APC)*
    - Sensors in bus doors
      - Use break beam sensors to tell if you're getting on or off (out of 2 beams which do you break first)
    - Counts from fare barriers
    - Load weight calculators on trains
      - In trains the brakes apply force proportional to the load in each car (lighter cars need less braking, heavier cars need more, so they dont run into each other)

** Passenger counting techniques
- Manual - checker (a person)
  - Ride check (on the bus, on/off counts and running time)
  - Point check (load on board, headway - time between buses)

** Sampling
- *Simple random sampling*
- *Systematic sampling* - every 6 days, etc
- *Cluster sampling* - do as much data collection as possible
- *Ratio estimation/Conversion factors*
- *Stratified sampling* - sample sizes for each thing separately
  - E.g. you want information about students: get a large sample size on routes that serve universities

** Tolerance and confidence level
- Accuracy has 2 dimensions
  - Relative tolerance: $\pm 10\%$
  - Absolute tolerance: $\pm 3.3$

* Modal Characteristics and Roles

** Spectrum of services
[[file:.images/modes.png]]

** Transit categories
- Rights of way - degree of separation
  - Surface with mixed traffic (light rail/buses)
  - Longitudinal separation by at grade crossing (light rail/bus rapid transit)
  - Full separation (at grade/tunnel/elevated)
- Technologies
  - Support (how they contact the groups)
    - Rubber tire on concrete (cars, buses, some rail like Paris Metro)
    - Steel wheel on steel rail
    - Maglev
    - Suspended cars
    - Water
    - Others
  - Guidance (lateral control)
    - Steered by driver
    - Guided by track
    - Others
  - Energy and propulsion
    - Combustion engine
    - Electric
    - Compressed natural gas (CNG)
    - Hybrid
    - Others
  - Control (longitudinal)
    - Manual/visual
    - Manual/signal
    - Automatic

** Basics of train control
- Divide the system into blocks
  - If a train is occupying a section, do not let any trains in the section immediately before
  - For each block further, slowly increase speed limit in that block from nothing (0, 10, 25, 40,...)
- Block system constrains the frequency of service
- Moving block system increases capacity, usually used with automatic driving systems

** Levels of automated protection
- None - advisory way signals
- Manual setting of speed below speed limit - train will be automatically braked if over speed limit
- Automatic train supervision/regulation
- Full automation - sometimes has operators, needs to have platform screen doors to keep people off of track
- Capacity increased through moving block or communication based train control

** What is a bus?
- Vehicle size - 10-250 passengers
- Floor height (high floor/low floor)
  - Low floor is better for accessibility, has lower dwell time
- Right of way - all options available
- Guidance - often manual, sometimes systems
- Propulsion - all options available
- Fare payment - pay outside, or pay in the bus

** Examples of bus systems
- Bi-articulated buses are a thing
- In Curitiba, bi-articulated buses have high floors, and have to be boarded at specific stations with fare gates
- The Cambridgeshire Guided Busway has buses operating on dedicated "tracks" of pavement
  [[file:.images/busway.jpg]]
  - Buses can also be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guided_bus#Optical_guidance][optically guided]], following a line on the floor with a camera

** Light Rail
- Vehicle design
  - High/low floor
  - Articulated or not
- Right of way
  - All options available
- Operation
  - Automated or manual
- Power
  - Overhead catenaries
  - Third rail
    - On street rails, the third rail is electronically controlled and is only powered when the train is coming

** Heavy Rail
- Length
  - Limited by station length
  - In some cases (like in London) they allow the last door of the last car to stay in the runnel
- Turning radius
- Right of way
  - At-grade
  - Elevated
  - Tunnel
- Station spacing
- Control
- Power

** Commuter Rail
- Vehicles operating in trains with long station spacing
- Fare collection strategies
- Line length
- Through routing in CBD [central business district] (cross through city or go there and back)
  - Where to put trains when you're done
- Station spacing
- Parking capacity

** Traditional and new service concepts
- Traditional
  - Bus on shared right of way
  - Streetcar on shared right of way
  - Heavy rail on exclusive ROW
  - Commuter/regional rail on semi-exclusive ROW
- New
  - Bus rapid transit
  - Light rail on exclusive ROW

** Increasing diversity
- Driver arrangements
  - Part timers (cover peaks), 10 hour day (to cover peaks that are 8 hours apart), payment by vehicle type
- Routing and scheduling
- Vehicle types
- control options
- Priority options
- Dual mode operation

** Bus vs rail comparison
- Rail advantages
  - Higher capacity
  - Lower unit operating cost
  - Better service quality
  - Stronger land use influence
  - Fewer negative externalities
- Bus advantages
  - Low capital costs
  - Wide network coverage
  - Single vehicle trips
  - Flexibility
  - Dual mode nature

* Short Range Planning

** Public transit planning
- Long range (>3 years)
  - Major capital investments, infrastructure
  - Usually in collaboration with government
- Medium range (1-3 years)
  - Fleet size, network size, fare policy
  - Usually in collaboration with government
- Short range (<1 year)
  - Route structure, service frequency
  - Incremental changes
  - Can be handled only by the transit authority
- Control (real time)
  - Revise schedule and route of specific vehicle

** Operational planning process
- Right of way + demand => bus route design => routes and stops
- Service + demand => set timetables => departure times
- Travel time constraints => scheduling vehicles => vehicle schedules
- Operator and union constraints => scheduling drivers => crew schedules

** Transit service guidelines
- Goals => objective => measures => standards
- Early arrivals are not considered on time, because it may still cause people to miss connections
- Purpose
  - Communicate to the public and their representatives how decisions are made on changes in the transit network and the allocation of resources
  - Ensure acceptable level of service quality
  - Provide a consistent and fair bases for
    - Evaluating existing services
    - Considering new services
  - Balance impreovements with efficient use of resources

** Aspects covered by service guidelines
- Service design
  - Factors that are important to riders:
    - Frequency
    - Waiting time
    - Reliability
    - Access
  - Why are frequency and waiting time both here?
    - Waiting time can be independent of waiting time - if a bus comes early, it will change waiting time
- Operating perfornace
  - Service quality

** Service design: schedule
- Two main components
  - Maximum (policy) headways
  - Maximum passenger crowding
    - Usually for peak corridors

* Short Range Planning, con't.

** Service reliability
- Walk up service
  - Schedule free
  - Headway-based, <10 minutes
  - Performance based on headway
- Scheduled service
  - >= 10 minute headway
  - Performance measurement based on punctuality

** Alternative benefit measures
- Revenue
  - Relevant to financial concerns and willingness to pay, discounts reduced fare trips and favors higher income passengers
- Passengers
  - Reflects number of people who benefit, values each passenger equally, but doesn't reflect trup length or linked trips
- Passenger miles
  - Weights longer trips more, but hardest to measure since most systems don't have an exit
- Net cost
  - Usually most directly constrained, but hardest to estimate (if you're planning a new service, you won't know revenue)
- Cost
  - Also directly constrained, but hard to estimate
- Vehicle miles
  - Easy to measure, only reflects ~30% of bus costs and penalized fast service
- Vehicle hours
  - Easy to measure, related to >50% bus costs, but doesn't reflect cost differences between peak and off-peak
