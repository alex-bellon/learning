* Introduction

** Transit right now
- Ridership is increasing, but small
- Strong financial support from
- Trends in modal split
  - Auto is above 80%
  - Transit 2-3%
  - Biking and walking are the same as transit

** Funding
- In North America, it's divided into captial and operating expenses
- Fares only pay ~1/3 of operational expenses
- Lots of federal support for capital expenses - almost 40%
  - Since operating expenses are funded less, this encourages more building and less maintenance
- Fuel taxes in NA are 10-20% of what they are in Europe

** Traditional Arguments Supporting Transit
- Equity: travel for those who can't drive
- Congestion
  - Not such a good argument, papers don't support it. The capacity released it quickly filled again
- Better for the environment
  - Actually, effort it better spent making cars cleaner since they're like 80% of transport

** Critical assessment
- Transport has been stabilized
- Success stories (NYC, Houston(?), Seattle)
- Institutional changes are occurring slowly

** Future influences
- Urban form
- More old people
- Better tech to improve performance
- Public has higher expectation (you know exactly when the bus is coming)

** Ingredients for future success
- Maintain supportive coalition
- Expand the definition of public transport
- Greater private sector involvement
- Aggressive implementation of new technology

* Data Collection Techniques and Program Design

** Summary of current practice
- Used to be manual
- Now is collected with IoT devices
- *Automated Data Collection Systems (ADCS)*
  - *Automated Fare Collection Systems (AFC)*
    - Tapping your card on/off the vehicle
  - *Automatic Vehicle Location Systems (AVL)*
    - GPS tracking for buses, train tracking based on circuit occupancy
  - *Automatic Passenger Counting Systems (APC)*
    - Sensors in bus doors
      - Use break beam sensors to tell if you're getting on or off (out of 2 beams which do you break first)
    - Counts from fare barriers
    - Load weight calculators on trains
      - In trains the brakes apply force proportional to the load in each car (lighter cars need less braking, heavier cars need more, so they dont run into each other)

** Passenger counting techniques
- Manual - checker (a person)
  - Ride check (on the bus, on/off counts and running time)
  - Point check (load on board, headway - time between buses)

** Sampling
- *Simple random sampling*
- *Systematic sampling* - every 6 days, etc
- *Cluster sampling* - do as much data collection as possible
- *Ratio estimation/Conversion factors*
- *Stratified sampling* - sample sizes for each thing separately
  - E.g. you want information about students: get a large sample size on routes that serve universities

** Tolerance and confidence level
- Accuracy has 2 dimensions
  - Relative tolerance: $\pm 10\%$
  - Absolute tolerance: $\pm 3.3$
