* Introduction

** Transit right now
- Ridership is increasing, but small
- Strong financial support from
- Trends in modal split
  - Auto is above 80%
  - Transit 2-3%
  - Biking and walking are the same as transit
** Funding
- In North America, it's divided into captial and operating expenses
- Fares only pay ~1/3 of operational expenses
- Lots of federal support for capital expenses - almost 40%
  - Since operating expenses are funded less, this encourages more building and less maintenance
- Fuel taxes in NA are 10-20% of what they are in Europe
** Traditional Arguments Supporting Transit
- Equity: travel for those who can't drive
- Congestion
  - Not such a good argument, papers don't support it. The capacity released it quickly filled again
- Better for the environment
  - Actually, effort it better spent making cars cleaner since they're like 80% of transport
** Critical assessment
- Transport has been stabilized
- Success stories (NYC, Houston(?), Seattle)
- Institutional changes are occurring slowly
** Future influences
- Urban form
- More old people
- Better tech to improve performance
- Public has higher expectation (you know exactly when the bus is coming)
** Ingredients for future success
- Maintain supportive coalition
- Expand the definition of public transport
- Greater private sector involvement
- Aggressive implementation of new technology
