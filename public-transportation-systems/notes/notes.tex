\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:org4e10f49}

\subsection{Transit right now}
\label{sec:orgbd76c6f}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ridership is increasing, but small
\item Strong financial support from
\item Trends in modal split
\begin{itemize}
\item Auto is above 80\%
\item Transit 2-3\%
\item Biking and walking are the same as transit
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Funding}
\label{sec:org112b780}
\begin{itemize}
\item In North America, it's divided into captial and operating expenses
\item Fares only pay \textasciitilde{}1/3 of operational expenses
\item Lots of federal support for capital expenses - almost 40\%
\begin{itemize}
\item Since operating expenses are funded less, this encourages more building and less maintenance
\end{itemize}
\item Fuel taxes in NA are 10-20\% of what they are in Europe
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Traditional Arguments Supporting Transit}
\label{sec:orge8c6687}
\begin{itemize}
\item Equity: travel for those who can't drive
\item Congestion
\begin{itemize}
\item Not such a good argument, papers don't support it. The capacity released it quickly filled again
\end{itemize}
\item Better for the environment
\begin{itemize}
\item Actually, effort it better spent making cars cleaner since they're like 80\% of transport
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Critical assessment}
\label{sec:org3e62b57}
\begin{itemize}
\item Transport has been stabilized
\item Success stories (NYC, Houston(?), Seattle)
\item Institutional changes are occurring slowly
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Future influences}
\label{sec:org3271824}
\begin{itemize}
\item Urban form
\item More old people
\item Better tech to improve performance
\item Public has higher expectation (you know exactly when the bus is coming)
\end{itemize}
